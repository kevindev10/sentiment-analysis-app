# AI-Powered Content Generator and Analyzer

This project is a scalable web application that combines AI technology with an interactive frontend to generate and analyze content. Built with **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**, and the **Gemini Developer API**, it handles high-concurrency workloads and ensures a seamless user experience.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Content Generation**: Generate contextual blog posts or articles based on user-provided topics.
- **Content Analysis**: Analyze generated or user-provided content for readability and sentiment.
- **Concurrency Management**: Efficiently handles multiple user requests with thread pools and semaphores.
- **Responsive Frontend**: Interactive and user-friendly interface built with Bootstrap.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: HTML, Jinja2, Bootstrap
- **AI Integration**: Gemini Developer API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Concurrency**: ThreadPoolExecutor, Semaphore
