# AI-Powered Content Generator and Analyzer

This project is a scalable web application that seamlessly integrates **AI-driven content generation and analysis** with an interactive frontend. Built with **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**, and the **Gemini Developer API**, it efficiently handles high-concurrency workloads while maintaining an intuitive user experience.

## 🚀 New Features & Enhancements
- **AI-Powered Content Generation**: Generate contextual blog posts or articles based on user-provided topics.
- **Sentiment & Readability Analysis**: Analyze content for readability and sentiment using the Gemini Developer API.
- **Optimized Concurrency Management**: Uses **ThreadPoolExecutor** and **semaphores** to efficiently handle multiple requests.
- **Interactive Frontend**: A sleek Bootstrap-powered UI with content import functionality for seamless analysis.
- **Improved Database Handling**: Persistent tracking of search terms, generated content, and sentiment evaluations.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Install Python 3.8+.
2. Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
3. Obtain your **Gemini API Key**.
4. Configure the `.env` file:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url>
   GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
   ```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-content-generator.git
   cd ai-content-generator
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head  # If migrations exist
   ```

### Usage
1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
2. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to access the interface.
3. Use the UI or API to generate and analyze content.
